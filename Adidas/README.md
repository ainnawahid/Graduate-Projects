# Sales Performance Dashboard (2020–2021)

## Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that analyzes Adidas' sales data across the United States from 2020 to 2021 (Kaggle). The aim is to help stakeholders identify trends, evaluate profitability, and make informed decisions based on interactive and visual insights.

## Business Problem

Adidas faced challenges in efficiently monitoring and analyzing sales performance due to a lack of centralized visualization tools. This limited their ability to:
- Identify key sales trends and regional performance
- Optimize pricing and resource allocation
- Forecast future sales and profitability

A Power BI dashboard was developed to overcome these challenges, offering data-driven insights into sales strategies, marketing effectiveness, and resource planning.

## Objectives

The key objectives of this dashboard project include:
- Analyzing sales by region, state, and product category
- Identifying top-performing retailers and profitable cities
- Evaluating pricing strategies and product-level profitability
- Forecasting sales and profit for the next six months

## Data Description

The primary dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes:
- 9,648 rows and 13 columns
- Key variables: Region, Invoice Date, Product, Units Sold, Sales Method, Operating Profit, Operating Margin, etc.

External datasets were also integrated:
- US state abbreviations
- Population density by state (for demographic comparison)

Data cleaning was conducted using Python (Pandas), ensuring integrity through:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Standardizing formats

## Tools and Techniques
